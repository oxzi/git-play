# ðŸŽµ git-play ðŸŽµ

`git play` finally allows you to listen to your code.
It's like `git ls-files`, but for your ears.


## Install

1. Clone this repository.
2. Put the `git-play` file in your `$PATH`.
   Either copy the file to, for example, `/usr/bin/` or adjust the `$PATH` variable accordingly.


## Usage

```bash
cd some-git-repository
git play
# Don't forget to max out your speakers
```

`git play` accepts the same parameters as `git ls-files`, so see `man git-ls-files`.
